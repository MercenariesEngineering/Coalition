Coalition
=========

Coalition is a light weight job manager to manage and run jobs on computers (workers).

The project is composed of:

* A python twisted matrix HTTP server (server.py), serving a [REST API] (http://mercenariesengineering.github.io/coalition/rest_api.html)
* A python client application (worker.py), which runs on the worker computers and communicates with the server.
* A [python API](http://mercenariesengineering.github.io/coalition/python_api.html) to control the server.

The documentation is built [here](http://mercenariesengineering.github.io/coalition).

The development version is 4.0.
