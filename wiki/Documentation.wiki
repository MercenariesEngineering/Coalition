= Jobs =

A job is a simple command to run on one of the workers. Each job has an ID chosen by the server.

== Job attributes ==

A job may have different attributes. For example, the job attribute *cmd* is the command to execute.

The different job attributes used to initialise a job are :

 * cmd
 * title
 * dir
 * parent
 * priority
 * dependencies
 * timeout
 * retry
 * affinities
 * url
 * user
 * localprogress
 * globalprogress

== Job execution ==

A new job is in the *WAITING* state.

When a worker run a job, it set the current working directory to *dir* and run the command *cmd*. The job is then in the *WORKING *state. If the command returns with the exit code 0, the job is put in the state *FINISHED*. If not, the job is put in the state *ERROR*.

If the job is in the *ERROR* state, the server will retry to run this job up to *retry* times.

If the job duration exceeds *timeout*, the server will kill this job and set it in the ERROR state.

== Job display ==

The *title* attribute is displayed in the user interface.

The *url* attribute is the url to open with the Open link in the user interface.

By default, the web browser blocks the URLs on local files.

On Firefox, it is possible to override this behavior. Chech this : http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_don%27t_work

== Job hierarchy ==

A job can be the parent of some children jobs. In this case, the parent job won't run any command. Even if the attribute *cmd* has been provided. 

The *parent* attribute can be specified to create a job into a previously created parent job. In this case, *parent* must be the ID of this parent job.

The hierarchy is useful to organize and schedule the different jobs.

=== Job dependencies ===

The *dependencies* attributes is a job ID list of the different jobs to finish before to run this job.

A list can be provided like this : "1,3,5".

=== Affinities ===

If a job has an *affinity* attribute, only the worker with at least all the affinities specified in the *affinity* attribute will be able to run this job.

For example, it the affinity attribute is initialised with "LINUX,24GB", the workers must have at least the "LINUX" and the "24GB" affinities to run this job.

== Owner ==

The *user* attributes is the user name of the owner of the job. If the emails are activated, the emails regarding this job will be sent at *user*.

If LDAP is configured, the job will be executed with the *user* rights.

== Job progression ==
