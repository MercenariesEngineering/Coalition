= Installation =
== Linux ==

There is no distribution but the SVN for the moment. So use the source Tab of google code and follow the instructions to download the source code.

Be sure to install pyton 2.5 and twisted matrix (for the server)

== Windows ==

=== For the users ===

A Windows installer is available [[http://code.google.com/p/coalition/downloads/list here]]. You can install the worker and/or the server. The server is a Windows service and the worker is a command line appliaction. The main
reason for the worker to not be a service is the services can't access the user's network drives.

Once installed, the services are started and are ready to use.

=== For the developers ===

Install python 2.5, and the corresponding twisted and win32api modules.

  * python : [http://www.python.org/download/windows/]
  * twisted (for the server) : [http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads]
  * win32api : [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018]

= Setup the farm =

The farm should include one server and some workers. 

You can first test the server monitor. It should be available through this URL : 
http://servername:19211

Once the services are up, the workers will try to connect the server. If all the different computers are on the same local network, the workers should locate the server by themself.

You can see the connected workers in the worker page on the monitor.

If the workers can't connect the server, you will have to edit the coalition.ini file present in the coalition directory of the workers and setup the option serverUrl like this:

serverUrl=http://servername:19211

Where "servername" is the name of the server and 19211 its port. 19211 is the default port for a coalition server.
